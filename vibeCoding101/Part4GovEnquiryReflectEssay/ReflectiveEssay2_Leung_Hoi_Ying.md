# Reflective Essay 2 - Leung Hoi Ying

**Date:** October 16, 2025

## Introduction

I completed a government-data enquiry exercise for Team 4's project on food waste recycling and the Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Charging Scheme. The task required identifying specific datasets, drafting formal requests, and considering alternative data sources if access is restricted.

## Main Body

I learned that Hong Kong provides useful open datasets but more granular program-level data often requires a formal request. In particular, I had to request: (1) detailed information about the Food Waste Recycling Scheme's core service targets across commercial, industrial, and household sectors, including their operational basis and Food Waste Separation and Recycling Bins' (FWSRBs) efficiency data, and (2) specific recycling rates and performance metrics for the Smart Food Waste Recycling Programme in Public Rental Housing estates, with a focus on their participation rate calculation methodology. Drafting the enquiry forced me to specify precise metrics and methodologiesâ€”an unexpectedly difficult step that improved my understanding of the data required for analysis. The AI agent helped by structuring the requests, suggesting alternative sources, and producing both letter and email drafts; I handled contextual wording and sensitivity decisions to maintain academic rigor and privacy protection. Compared with the course chatbot tutor, the AI assistant was task-focused and efficient but depended on my direction for local policy nuance. Through this process I improved practical skills in data-governance thinking and formal government communication.

## Conclusion

Access to these government datasets will enable us to comprehensively evaluate Hong Kong's current food waste recycling scheme and benchmark its performance against international standards. Furthermore, my team can use this baseline data to simulate how the implementation of the Municipal Solid Waste Charging Scheme might influence participation rates in food waste recycling programs. If our data requests are denied, we will rely on public datasets and case studies, though this would limit our simulation's accuracy. This exercise highlighted how precise data collection supports evidence-based policy analysis and future program planning.
