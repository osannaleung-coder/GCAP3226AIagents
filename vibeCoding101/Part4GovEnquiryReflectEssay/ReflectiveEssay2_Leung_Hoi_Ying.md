# Reflective Essay 2 - Leung Hoi Ying

**Date:** October 16, 2025

## Introduction

For Team 4's project on food waste recycling and the Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Charging Scheme, I completed a government-data enquiry exercise to obtain essential program data.

## Main Body

While Hong Kong provides open datasets, I found that detailed program-level data requires formal requests. I focused on two key areas: (1) the Food Waste Recycling Scheme's core service targets and operational data across sectors, including Food Waste Separation and Recycling Bins' efficiency, and (2) the Smart Food Waste Recycling Programme's performance in Public Rental Housing estates. Drafting these requests challenged me to be precise about metrics and methodologies. The AI agent assisted with request structuring and alternative data sources, while I managed contextual decisions about policy nuances and data sensitivity. This collaboration improved my understanding of data governance and formal communication with government departments.

## Conclusion

The requested data will help us evaluate Hong Kong's food waste recycling performance and create simulations to predict how the MSW Charging Scheme might boost recycling participation. If denied access, we'll use public data and case studies, though with limited simulation accuracy. This exercise taught me how proper data collection enables evidence-based policy planning.
