# Reflective Essay 2 - Leung Hoi Ying

**Date:** October 16, 2025

## Introduction

I completed a government-data enquiry exercise for Team 4's project on food waste recycling and the Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Charging Scheme. The task required identifying specific datasets, drafting formal requests, and considering alternative data sources if access is restricted.

## Main Body

I learned that Hong Kong provides useful open datasets but more granular program-level data often requires a formal request. In particular, I had to request: (1) participation rates of households and organizations in the food waste recycling scheme, (2) comparative performance data to benchmark Hong Kong against cities like Singapore and Seoul, (3) recycling rates and participation figures for the Smart Food Waste Recycling Programme in Public Rental Housing, and (4) analyses or projections of how the MSW Charging Scheme may affect food waste generation and recycling rates. Drafting the enquiry forced me to specify precise variables, formats and time rangesâ€”an unexpectedly difficult step that improved my understanding of the data required for modelling. The AI agent helped by structuring the requests, suggesting alternative sources, and producing both letter and email drafts; I handled contextual wording and sensitivity decisions to maintain academic rigor and privacy protection. Compared with the course chatbot tutor, the AI assistant was task-focused and efficient but depended on my direction for local policy nuance. Through this process I improved practical skills in data-governance thinking and formal government communication.

## Conclusion

Access to government data will strengthen our analysis by providing district-level participation and program performance metrics. If requests are denied, I will use public datasets, targeted field surveys and case studies as backups. The exercise reinforced that careful enquiry design and access to granular data are central to evidence-based policymaking.
