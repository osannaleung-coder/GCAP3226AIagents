# Reflective Essay 2 - Leung Hoi Ying

**Date:** October 16, 2025

## Introduction

I completed a government-data enquiry exercise for Team 4's project on food waste recycling and the Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Charging Scheme. The task required identifying specific datasets, drafting formal requests, and considering alternative data sources if access is restricted.

## Main Body

I learned that Hong Kong provides useful open datasets but more granular program-level data often requires a formal request. In particular, I had to request: (1) detailed information about the Food Waste Recycling Scheme's core service targets across commercial, industrial, and household sectors, including their operational basis and Food Waste Separation and Recycling Bins' (FWSRBs) efficiency data, and (2) specific recycling rates and performance metrics for the Smart Food Waste Recycling Programme in Public Rental Housing estates, with a focus on their participation rate calculation methodology. Drafting the enquiry forced me to specify precise metrics and methodologiesâ€”an unexpectedly difficult step that improved my understanding of the data required for analysis. The AI agent helped by structuring the requests, suggesting alternative sources, and producing both letter and email drafts; I handled contextual wording and sensitivity decisions to maintain academic rigor and privacy protection. Compared with the course chatbot tutor, the AI assistant was task-focused and efficient but depended on my direction for local policy nuance. Through this process I improved practical skills in data-governance thinking and formal government communication.

## Conclusion

Access to government data will strengthen our analysis by providing district-level participation and program performance metrics. If requests are denied, I will use public datasets, targeted field surveys and case studies as backups. The exercise reinforced that careful enquiry design and access to granular data are central to evidence-based policymaking.
